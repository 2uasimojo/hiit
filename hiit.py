#   to generate a workout with `ex_per_cycle` exercises.
#   https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq
# - The `_` (underscore) is where we would normally put the loop variable, like
#   `i`. But we don't have a use for that variable -- we just want to run the
#   loop a certain number of times -- so we use `_`, which by convention

        #   make sure we don't duplicate exercises in a workout.

        #   the venn diagram) of `v` (this exercise's muscle groups) and
        #   `last_groups` (the set of muscle groups from the previous iteration

        #   group two exercises in a row.

        # False for the condition to fire. In Python, in addition to actual
        # True and False, other data types are implicitly True or False if
        # they're non-empty or empty, respectively. In this case an empty set

# generated `workout` list of exercises) and produces one long string where
# all the elements of the sequence are joined together, separated by the
